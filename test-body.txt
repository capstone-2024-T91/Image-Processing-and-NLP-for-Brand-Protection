Dear students,
   
The Spring-Summer term is almost here, and it's a good time to make sure your passport, study permit, and visa or eTA (electronic travel authorization) are up to date.
 
Why is this important? Your immigration documents need to be valid for your entire program. If any of these documents are about to expire, you'll need to apply to extend them.
 
Here's what you need to know:
To extend a study permit, you must apply from within Canada. If you're not going to be in Canada when your study permit expires, you'll need to apply for a new one from outside the country.
Important change: As of January 22, the process for applying for a study permit from outside Canada has changed. Now, most applicants, including those returning to uOttawa, will need a Provincial Attestation Letter (PAL).
What should you do? Check your documents now. If you need to apply for a study permit and require a PAL, please let us know by replying to this email no later than Tuesday, April 2nd, 2024.
 
Not sure if you need to apply? We recommend attending our virtual SOS Immigration sessions to discuss your situation with an immigration adviser. Our sessions alternate between Thursdays at 10:00 a.m. and Wednesdays at 1:00 p.m. Eastern time.
 
If you have any questions, you can contact us at imm-intl@uottawa.ca.
 
King regards,

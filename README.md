# Image-Processing-and-NLP-for-Brand-Protection

Malicious phishing websites change constantly and go through significant efforts to mimic legitimate websites. New phishing websites that impersonate companies are created every day, and always contain minor differences to evade automated detection methods. How could we use machine learning, natural language processing (NLP) and image recognition algorithms to automatically cluster and attribute malicious websites? The project will consist at developing a Machine Learning model for the early identification of Phishing sites.
